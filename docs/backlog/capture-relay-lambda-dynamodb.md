title: 3. The capture relay — AWS Lambda Function URL + DynamoDB, $0/month

Telegram webhooks post to a small always-on function that appends to a queue; the home app drains it
outbound over HTTPS. Full design in `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` P1-6 — the shape, the three routes, the
`secret_token` that keeps the endpoint from being an open "add an expense" API, and the cutover order.

Costs nothing at ~20 messages/day: Lambda's 1M requests and 400k GB-seconds and DynamoDB's 25 WCU/25
RCU/25 GB are permanent allowances, not trial credits. **Use a Function URL, not API Gateway** — the
gateway's free tier lasts 12 months and a research brief built a "$0" claim on top of it.

The bot token never leaves the PC in this design, so the settled secrets rule survives; the price is that
the "saved" acknowledgement arrives late, when the machine returns.

**It narrows the gap, it does not close it.** The same 24-hour buffer applies to webhook mode, and
Telegram retries a failing webhook for an undocumented number of attempts. It removes the PC's uptime
from the equation — a large reduction, not a guarantee.

Platform barely matters at this size: GCP Cloud Run functions + Firestore, Azure Functions Consumption,
Cloudflare Workers + Queues and Deno Deploy all sit two to three orders of magnitude inside their free
tiers. Cloudflare's Queues pull/ack API is the best *shape* — it is literally the drain and ack endpoints
— but it is TypeScript only, a second toolchain for ~100 lines.
