title: Multi-item capture from one message
status: deferred
area: telegram

**Wanted.** `кофе 250 рсд, такси 500 рсд` in a single Telegram message becoming two line items.

**Why it is not in Phase 1.** An explicit non-goal, recorded so it is a decision rather than an
oversight. The multi-`LineItem` design is framed around Phase 4 receipts, and `Transaction` already
holds a collection of them, so this is a change to the extraction contract and the worker — not to the
schema.
